            <h3>Privacy built in from the start.</h3>
            <p>
            Many have believed Bitcoin can be 'anonymous'—but that’s a myth. In reality, Bitcoin is a transparent ledger, where every transaction,  
            including amounts, sender/receiver addresses, and more, are permanently visible online. Bitcoin’s transparency makes it even less private 
            than a traditional bank account. That’s why cypherpunks designed Monero with default privacy, from the ground up. Just like physical cash.

                  <p>
                  With Monero, your financial activity stays truly private. 
                  No corporation, government, or third party can view your transaction details. Only the sender and receiver know the amount    
                  transferred — and no one can see your balance. Your money, your business.

                  <p>
                  Monero is an open-source, independently audited project that upholds the highest security standards crafted by 
                  some of the brightest minds in cryptography and blockchain. Monero development is supported by a <a href="https://
                  ccs.getmonero.org/" target="_blank">Community Crowdfunding System</a> which enables continuous innovation.

                  <p>
                  Monero restores your right to financial privacy. With privacy-by-default, it protects users from mass surveillance and 
                  censorship, safeguarding true personal freedom. Need transparency? Monero offers that too — selectively. Individuals or 
                  organizations can prove their balances when they choose.

                  Monero maintains a low and constantly decreasing annual inflation rate.

            <h3>Bitcoin Isn’t a Privacy Solution</h3>
            <p>
              Bitcoin is a powerful project that pushes governments to compete with private, hard money.
              But it’s a mistake to believe it solves privacy concerns. While Bitcoin’s transparency benefits institutions that require public
              auditing, most individuals and businesses will prefer truly private money — because no one wants to expose their entire financial
              history with every transaction.

          <h3>Watch Dr. Daniel Kim Explain Monero's Value</h3>
          <p>
          Monero is a project from the cypherpunk community, completely decentralized, without any central authority
          directing it. It is impossible to censor, unlike with transparent Bitcoin addresses. Monero is unstoppable money for all.

            <p class="description"> Monero’s true anonymity makes it a digital offshore account — without the need for banks or bureaucratic barriers.
            Banning it would be nearly impossible: Monero runs on a decentralized network that cannot be shut down.
            And ironically, even governments could find value in using Monero to discreetly move or protect their own assets.Watch this video below

            <p class="description">
            Monero is scarce, private money — a combination that mirrors the appeal of physical gold.
            Its built-in utility ensures demand won't vanish with a ban; it would only intensify, driving even greater scarcity and pushing prices
            higher. Monero is anti-fragile: it protects both your wealth from inflation and your finances from surveillance.

          <h3>A Smart Addition to Your Investment Portfolio</h3>
          <p>
            Monero is a cryptocurrency like no other.
            With a low correlation to Bitcoin, it offers true diversification — a critical factor for maximizing future returns.
            Today, Monero is a $3.2 billion asset aiming to disrupt the offshore banking market.
            In a world where money is becoming fully digital, does it make sense to rely on physical offshore accounts to protect your wealth?
            Monero offers a smarter, more private solution for the digital age.

            Without access to expensive forensic tools, it’s impossible to know if a Bitcoin transaction is "tainted".
            Monero changes that. 
            With full default privacy, it protects individuals from unjust scrutiny and safeguards honest users from being falsely implicated.

      <h2>Want to Acquire Monero?</h2>
      <p>
        Because Monero is so effective at protecting privacy, governments worldwide have pressured traditional 
        cryptocurrency exchanges to delist it — making it harder for citizens to purchase Monero with local currency. 
        Fortunately, the Monero community is global and resilient. Thanks to the voluntary efforts of developers and supporters, 
        easy alternatives now exist. Explore the options below and find the best way for you to acquire Monero.

                Monero is a cryptocurrency, just like Bitcoin. Monero is an open-source software project that runs on
                its own blockchain and it serves as a currency, just like the dollar.
                Many people leave their computers "mining" it, which means they lend their PC's processing power in
                order to validate all transactions on the network.
                By doing this, all this processing power is used to guarantee fair emission of new coins (which causes
                the decreasing annual inflation of {{ inflation }}) and to protect your money
                from hackers. Monero has a decreasing inflation that will eventually tend to zero, and because low
                inflation leads to scarcity, it works as a store of value, just like Gold or Bitcoin.
                Differently from Bitcoin, though, Monero has full privacy, which means it hides your balance and your
                transactions from being visible on the network for others.

                Monero has cutting edge privacy tech, such as RingCTs, Stealth Addresses, Bulletproofs and Dandelion++.
                Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCTs) are used to obfuscate the sender of a transaction and the
                amount,
                while one-time stealth addresses are used to hide the address of the recipient using a method known as
                DKSAP. Bulletproofs is a protocol that improved RingCTs, reducing
                the size of the transactions, resulting in faster verification times and lower fees. Dandelion++ on the
                other hand was developed to obscure the IP address of the sender device.

                Monero developers have already tested the concept of atomic swaps between it and Bitcoin, which will
                happen directly from Monero's wallet and will be processed
                through Bitcoin's blockchain. Users in the near future will be able to swap easily one asset to the
                other, without having to rely on central authorities, such as
                exchanges, making it the best possible privacy solution for Bitcoin. In other words, to ban Monero,
                governments would first have to censor the whole Bitcoin
                blockchain, which won't happen, because Bitcoin is already rooted in society. So nobody will be able to
                prevent people from having privacy.

                There was never a premine on Monero. This means no one controls vast amounts of coins, since all coins
                ever generated have always been distributed for the miners. The miners
                receive coins based on how much work they put into validating and defending the network, so it is a form
                of financial revenue they get for their service. Since at the
                beginning (2014) there were no coins in circulation, inflation was high. Now that there are {{
                supply}} units in circulation, the annual inflation is just {{ inflation }}.
                The payout per block decreases over time, and so will the the annual inflation rate slowly decrease
                towards zero. The demand for fungible, digital, privacy-oriented hard money will likely skyrocket
                in the next few years and outpace its inflation, so investors expect a considerable rise in prices.

                Bitcoin's price is way higher than Monero's since the former was introduced in 2009, while the latter
                only in 2014. When Bitcoin was created, the technology
                behind Monero didn't even exist. Bitcoin's methods were themselves a huge leap in tech. Now Bitcoin has
                a legion of investors, is an established cryptocurrency,
                and have a 1T USD marketcap. However Bitcoin has many flaws, such as transaction cost and time, and
                mostly lack of privacy. Bitcoin has no privacy at all.
                All transactions and balances are stored in a chain of blocks, and are totally visible for all internet
                users. In this sense, Bitcoin can't work as money,
                because one of the main atributes of a good money is fungibility, which is ability for all units being
                indistinguishble from the others. Since all Bitcoins' transactions
                are visible, you can differentiate one from the other. For example, you can choose to accept
                transactions from one address, but choose to forbid people from accepting
                another. This will inevitably allow governments to censor certain addresses based on what their owners
                are doing. Therefore, the lack of fungibility isn't a desired
                feature for good money. In this sense, Monero is much better money than Bitcoin. Monero is faster,
                cheaper to transact and completely fungible. You can't see differences
                between different Moneroj (Moneroj is plural from Monero), so you also can't censor people. With Monero
                people are free, while with Bitcoin people
                are at the mercy of their governments leaders.

                While nobody can predict exactly what will happen in the future, Monero's community expect that there
                will be huge demand for privacy in the next few years. With
                our society relying more on digital processes, it is plausible that such type of tech will eventually
                find its niche in our daily lives. Monero is a bet
                on the digitalization of money, a bet in the need for privacy and also a bet that governments will lose
                the monopoly over money. In term of returns, while BTC took 900
                days to achieve 37x in its first bull market cycle, Monero took 1279 days to give 95x return. However
                you must not take this as financial advice, and you should
                invest at your own risk.

                Simply put, open an account on a trusted exchange, such as Kraken or Binance. You just need to write
                your data in their form. After that, complete
                the whole registration process, which may include KYC procedures, like sending them a picture of your
                document and face. Also remember to enable two-factor
                authentication, which prevents hackers from stealing your funds and also allow withdrawals. Then send a
                wire transfer to the exchange and in a few hours they will
                update your balance. When this happens, buy your Monero and proceed for withdrawals.

                Now download a software wallet for Monero on your phone (such as Cake Wallet or Monerujo), or for your
                computer (the official wallet). You can also buy
                a hardware wallet such as the Ledger. When you complete this step, you can login on your exchange
                account and ask for a withdrawal of funds. This means
                you are going to ask the exchange to send all your Moneroj from your account into the address of your
                wallet. After that, you already have full control of your
                funds.
